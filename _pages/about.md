## My cat
I have a cat that I adopted with my partner. He is a one-year-old boy named MayoHachi. Mayo means egg yolk and Hachi means eight in Japanese. We named it because the color of his coat resembles egg yolk and he was found on the eighth floor.

## My life
I like playing badminton, volleyball and basketball And has received some awards in school. At the same time, like most young people, I like to play video games. I like to play some relaxing or decryption games. My favorite IPs are Ace Attorney and Animal Crossing.
Since I am quiet busy at work now, I have almost given up these hobbies and only work is left in my life.
