## Introduction
I am a software engineer currently working in China. I am interested in programming language (especially in GC ), virtual machine and compiler. Since my previous studies focused on semiconductors and wireless communications, I was just a rookie in above fields. This website was created for the stage conconlusion of my studies. My work uses C++ for programming, and during my master's degree, I used MATLAB extensively for simulation. In addition, I also used python, verilog, c in some coursework.

## My Resume

- B.E. in Optical and Electronic Information, Electronic Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, 2020
- Summer Internship. in School of Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University, Japan, 2019
- M.S. in Global Engineering and Development, Environment and Society (Wireless Communication Engieeering), Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, 2022

## My cat
I adopted this cat with my partner. He is a one-year-old boy, and we named him MayoHachi. Mayo means egg yolk and Hachi means eight in Japanese. The reason we use this name is because the color of his coat resembles egg yolk and he was snooping around for food on the eighth floor of one office building when we found him (and captured him after of course).

## My life
I like playing badminton, volleyball and basketball And has received some awards in school. At the same time, like most young people, I like to play video games. I like to play some relaxing or decryption games. My favorite IPs are Ace Attorney and Animal Crossing.
Since I am quiet busy at work now, I have almost given up these hobbies and only work is left in my life.
